# LanguageConstructionKit

This is a tool meant to make the construction and translation of fantasy languages easier, quicker, and more organized.

So far, I've got language loading done. Saving is not implemented yet. The translator tool is coming along, I have just a little more functionality to polish. Word tool GUI might be redone now that I've discovered SpringConstraints. Needs a lot of functionality work.
